<h1>BINARY-PROGRAM</h1>
<BR>
<p>This is repo for beginner whose has some issue or problem in DIGITAL ELECTRONICS and programming , it is specially made for you to understand both Digital electronics and how it work in computer's. Using C ,I tried to make it as easy as possible</p>
<BR>
<p>I have coded three very basic but important concept.</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li>BCD</li>
<li>Binary-To-ASCII</li>
<li>Binary-Multiplication</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<h2>BCD</h2>
<BR>
<p>BCD(BINARY-CODED DECIMAL) is commonly used in applications like digital clocks, calculators, and other devices where the binary representation needs to align closely with human-readable decimal numbers. It’s particularly handy for avoiding errors when converting between binary and decimal</p>
<p>In BCD, each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by a 4-bit binary equivalent. This system ensures that the binary representation remains easily convertible to human-readable decimal numbers.<br>
<ul>
<li>Advantages of BCD<br>
<ol>
<li>Readability: BCD directly represents decimal digits, making it easier to display data on devices like calculators and digital clocks.</li>
<li>Error Reduction: It avoids errors during conversion between binary and decimal formats.</li>
<li>Ease of Use: Well-suited for hardware-based arithmetic operations and display systems.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitations<br>
<ol>
<li>Inefficient Use of Bits: Since only 10 out of 16 possible binary combinations are used in each 4-bit group, it’s not as compact as pure binary.</li>
<li>Complexity in Arithmetic Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, etc., in BCD requires additional rules compared to standard binary arithmetic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
