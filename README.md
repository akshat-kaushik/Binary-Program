<h1>BINARY-PROGRAM</h1>
<BR>
<p>This is repo for beginner whose has some issue or problem in DIGITAL ELECTRONICS and programming , it is specially made for you to understand both Digital electronics and how it work in computer's. Using C ,I tried to make it as easy as possible.</p>
<BR>
<p>WE have to extra bonus programs "AllASCIIVal.c" will print all ASCII Value from 0 to 127 and "Check-Character.c" will check and gives the certain character value example:- 'A'=65 , 'a'=97 , etc.</p>
<BR>
<p>I have coded three very basic but important concept.</p>
<BR>
<ul>
<li>BCD</li>
<li>Binary-To-ASCII</li>
<li>Binary-Multiplication</li>
</ul>
<BR>
<h2>BCD</h2>
<BR>
<p>BCD(BINARY-CODED DECIMAL) is commonly used in applications like digital clocks, calculators, and other devices where the binary representation needs to align closely with human-readable decimal numbers. It’s particularly handy for avoiding errors when converting between binary and decimal.</p>
<p>In BCD, each decimal digit (0-9) is represented by a 4-bit binary equivalent. This system ensures that the binary representation remains easily convertible to human-readable decimal numbers.<br>
<ul>
<li>Advantages of BCD<br>
<ol>
<li>Readability: BCD directly represents decimal digits, making it easier to display data on devices like calculators and digital clocks.</li>
<li>Error Reduction: It avoids errors during conversion between binary and decimal formats.</li>
<li>Ease of Use: Well-suited for hardware-based arithmetic operations and display systems.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Limitations<br>
<ol>
<li>Inefficient Use of Bits: Since only 10 out of 16 possible binary combinations are used in each 4-bit group, it’s not as compact as pure binary.</li>
<li>Complexity in Arithmetic Operations: Performing addition, subtraction, etc., in BCD requires additional rules compared to standard binary arithmetic.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><br>
<ul>
<li>1 → 0001</li>
<li>2 → 0010</li>
<li>3 → 0011</li>
<li>4 → 0100</li>
<li>5 → 0101</li>
<li>6 → 0110</li>
<li>7 → 0111</li>
<li>8 → 1000</li>
<li>9 → 1001</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Binary To ASCII</h2>
<BR>
<p>To convert binary to ASCII code, each binary value (typically an 8-bit binary number) corresponds to a character in the ASCII table. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and it represents characters (letters, digits, symbols, etc.) using numbers.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Here’s how the conversion process works:<br>
<ol>
<li>Convert the String into Integer and store it in a variable.</li>
<li>Create a variable num intial value zero, then run a loop for each charater in a String.</li>
<li>Now just add <p>2<sup>6</sup></p> to num in a array bin[0] store 1 compare it to i if num is greater then i num=num-<p>2<sup>6</sup></p> and bin[0] = 0.</li>
<li>Repeat this process for <p>2<sup>n-1</sup> and also for all other charaters.</p></li>
<li>Now print the value you get, that is your ASCII value.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<BR>
<h2>Binary Multiplication</h2>
<BR>
<p>Binary multiplication is the process of multiplying two binary numbers (composed of only 0s and 1s) by following simple rules of multiplication.It's similar to regular multiplication, but much simpler since we only deal with two digits. It is fundamental in computer systems and digital electronics for performing arithmetic calculations.</p>
<BR>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Rules of Binary Multiplication<br>
<ol>
<li>0 × 0 = 0</li>
<li>0 × 1 = 0</li>
<li>1 × 0 = 0</li>
<li>1 × 1 = 1</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Steps for Binary Multiplication<br>
<ol>
<li>Multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number, just like in decimal multiplication.</li>
<li>Align the results based on their positions (like in a multiplication table).</li>
<li>Add the results using binary addition.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Applications of Binary Multiplication<br>
<ol>
<li>Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Essential for processing audio, images, and signals.</li>
<li>Computer Arithmetic: In processors and hardware to perform mathematical operations.</li>
<li>Algorithms and Encryption: Where binary operations play a major role.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<BR>
<p>BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal), Binary to ASCII code, and Binary Multiplication are fundamental concepts in digital electronics and computing. BCD simplifies the representation of decimal numbers in binary form, making it useful in devices like calculators and digital clocks. Binary to ASCII code bridges the gap between binary data and human-readable characters, enabling efficient communication between machines and humans. Binary Multiplication, a straightforward method following simple rules, is essential for performing arithmetic operations in binary systems and underpins many computational processes. Together, these concepts play crucial roles in the functioning and design of digital systems, enhancing both their efficiency and usability.</p>
